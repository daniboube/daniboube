## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Daniel Boubeta, a fullstack developer and technology enthusiast from Galiza, Spain.

Among my interests, I love developing eye-catching web applications, learning about artificial intelligence and tinkering with electronics to build IoT devices for my own use. But one of my extra-professional hobbies is game design, since I'm a big fan of board games, so don't be surprised if you find some projects related to that too. At this moment, I'm working as a researcher at the University of A CoruÃ±a.

So welcome to my GitHub profile. Take a look and happy coding!
