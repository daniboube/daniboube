## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Daniel Boubeta, a fullstack developer and technology enthusiast from Galiza, Spain.

Among my many interests, I love developing eye-catching web and mobile applications, learning about the lastest artificial intelligence technologies, and experimenting with electronics to create IoT devices for my own use. But one of the extra-professional hobbies I enjoy the most is game design, as I'm a big fan of board games, so don't be surprised if you find a few projects related to that here, too. Finally, regarding my professional career, I work as a researcher at the University of A CoruÃ±a, in Galiza.

So, welcome to my GitHub profile. Take a look and happy coding!
